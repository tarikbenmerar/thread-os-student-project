# Multi-Threading IPC OS Student Project

## The story behind
This is a particular project from my student life. Rather then doing things in raw spaghetti code as others, 
I have created a well designed OOP project in 2 weeks (Others spent 2 semesters on it) with minimal bug. 
Unfortunately, the teacher didn't take notice and gave me a bad mark (13.5/20).
